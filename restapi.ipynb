    "# Developing REST APIs with Amazon API Gateway\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview and objectives\n",
    "In this project, I will create a REST application programming interface (API) by using Amazon API Gateway.\n",
    "\n",
    "After reading this document, you also should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create simple mock endpoints for REST APIs and use them in your website.\n",
    "- Enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scenario\n",
    "In the previous lab, I took on the role of Sofía to build a web application for the café. As part of this process, I created an Amazon DynamoDB table that was named FoodProducts, where I stored information about café menu items.\n",
    "\n",
    "I then loaded data that was formatted in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) into the database table. The table structure looked similar to the following table (one line item of table data is shown as an example):\n",
    "\n",
    "| product_name | description | price_in_cents |product_id | tags3 | special |\n",
    "|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|\n",
    "|  apple pie slice   |  A delicious slice of Frank's homemade pie.   |  595   |  a444   |  [ { \"S\" : \"pie slice\" }, { \"S\" : \"on offer\" } ]   |  1   |\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous lab I also configured code that used the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Scan a DynamoDB table to retrieve product details.\n",
    "- Return a single item by product name using get-item as a proof of concept\n",
    "- Create a Global Secondary Index (GSI) called special_GSI that you could use to filter out menu items that are on offer and not out of stock.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I will continue the role of Sofía. I will use Amazon API Gateway to configure mock data endpoints. There are three that I will create:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [GET] /products (which will eventually invoke a DynamoDB table scan)\n",
    "- [GET] /products/on_offer (which will eventually invoke a DynamoDB index scan and filter)\n",
    "- [POST] /create_report (which will eventually trigger a batch process that will send out a report)\n",
    "\n",
    "Then in the [project that follows this one](), I will replace the mock endpoints with real endpoints, so that the web application can connect to the DynamoDB backend.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you start the AWS simulation, the following resources are pre-created in the account.\n",
    "\n",
    "![start-arch](images/start-arch.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "However, by the end of this project, I have created the following architecture:\n",
